# **Tip Calculator**
### Python Tip Calculator Description:
The program will prompt the user for the following inputs:
1.	How much was the bill amount (before tax and tip)
2.	Percentage of the tip they want to give
3.	An option to split the bill
4. There is also an option to strat the program over, in case the user made an input error.

This program allows the user to input any dollar & cents amount. 
Finally, the program will output the total bill including 10% tax (which is calculated automatically), and the amount each person needs to pay (including tax & tip), if decided to split the bill.
